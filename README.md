# NixAGui
*Nix Based UI for SMP/Altiris (Linux, CentOS, Ubuntu, Kubuntu | Gnome, KDE)

Basic UI interface for various SMP/Altiris agent & plugins (not tested on MacOS).

Intended use:

Always free.

Basic availability to agent/plugins commands in a UI format for support staff or end user (not all commands are available through the UI) i.e.: users can not stop the agent in the UI, only restart.

The UI was designed to be 'similar' in appearance to bring experience familarity to it's usage, not intended as an infringement on copyrights to the SMP Agent UI for Windows, it was designed with this in mind. 

It does not bind or hook through code to the agent or any of the plugins. All functions are processing 'CLI' calls that are made available by Symantec.

No warranty given, use at your own discretion. All attempts have been made to make sure that the UI does not change any of the configuration information media (*.conf files, *.xml files | all processes are read only).

Usage:

IF the intention is use in a production environment, it can not be stressed enough that you should test, test and test again before deploying it.

ALWAYS scan for viruses after downloading (source and binaries are stored in environment outside personal control of coder), use the following methodology: Trust but, VERIFY! a.k.a Zero Trust

What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust is a security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access.

Updates:

Will be made available here.
